- Lecture 2:
    - Kieran's chapter 3 for half of the lecture
    - Add the dinosaur to highlight why it is necessary to look at the data
    - Start some data cleaning/reading, based on whatever it is that is necessary for the Gabor and Gabor book
- Lecture 3:
    - Finish Kieran's chapter 3, probably I won't need much else from his book for this, do I?
    - Some more stuff from Gabor and Gabor

Starting in lecture 2, I should have a bigger worked example (or using a subset of it), as well as many smaller exercises that drive home the same point as before.

Write down something like a design recipe from HTDP2, but for the R data analysis stuff. Programming the students.

- Have a section on "Being able to read R code", where I include ways of doing things that are not necessarily from tidyverse
